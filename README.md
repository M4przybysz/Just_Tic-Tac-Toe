# TicTacToe-made-with-SDL2
It is just a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Nothing less. Nothing more.

Rules are the same as in classical tic-tac-toe, but there is only one player (X) playing against a bot (O). (and X always plays first)
- You can download compiled version from here: https://merlin-kuro.itch.io/just-tictactoe

### Bot thought process:
1) Search for win in 1 move.
2) If there is no win in 1 turn then search for player win in 1 move.
3) If both previous conditions are not met then place an O in a random position.

This project is a tic-tac-toe game made with C++ and SDL2. 
In this project I aim for simpliicty and minimalistic design.
